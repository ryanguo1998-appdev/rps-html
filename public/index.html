            Rock-paper-scissors (also known as paper, scissors, stone or other variants) is a hand game usually played between two people, in which each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with an outstretched hand.
        </p>
        <p>
            These shapes are:
            <ul>
                <li>"rock" (a closed fist)</li>
                <li>"paper" (a flat hand)</li>
                <li>"scissors" (a fist with the index and middle fingers extended, forming a V)</li>

            </ul>
